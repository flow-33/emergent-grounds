🌱 Purpose:
Create the visual and structural foundation for the Emergent Grounds two-person conversation interface.

This is part of the MVE (Minimal Viable Experience), where two anonymous participants will enter a shared space to co-create meaningful, inquiry-based dialogue. The UI must reflect the principles of simplicity, presence, and emotional spaciousness.

---

🔧 Technical Expectations:
- HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only (no frameworks).
- Minimalist styling with soft colors, rounded corners, and poetic whitespace.
- Semantic and accessible markup.

---

🖼️ UI Requirements:

1. **Full-screen layout** with centered conversation panel.
2. **Message area**: shows back-and-forth dialogue with poetic names (e.g. “Curious Fox”, “Quiet River”).
   - Messages from each speaker appear on opposite sides.
   - AI system messages appear centered or subtly styled differently.
3. **Input area**:
   - A single text input field at the bottom.
   - Submit button with a symbolic label (e.g. “Send” could be “Plant” or “Offer”).
4. **Poetic placeholder text** in input (e.g. “What wants to be said?”).
5. Optional but appreciated:
   - Space for “ritual” or “reflection” prompts to appear from the system.

---

🎨 Design Hints (not strict):
- Background: light parchment, soft beige, or slightly earthy tone.
- Message bubbles: subtle gradients, soft shadows, rounded corners.
- Font: Friendly and calm (e.g. system-ui, serif, or optionally Google Fonts like Quicksand or Nunito).

---

📎 Notes:
- No login or session storage required yet.
- This is static markup and styling only — interaction and real-time logic will come later.
- Use placeholder names for now (e.g. “Reflecting Bear” and “Listening Brook”).

🌿 Tone Reminder:
This space is not transactional. It is meant to be quiet, curious, and spacious. Let the code reflect that. Comment generously and name things poetically if helpful.

Once complete, the next step will be real-time session management.
