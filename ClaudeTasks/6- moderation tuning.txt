Project Context:
This is for Emergent Grounds, a web-based two-person dialogue platform where an AI moderator supports inquiry-driven, respectful, insight-generating conversations. The tone is gentle, adaptive, and humanistic. The platform is already live at emergentgrounds.org and has implemented reflection intervals, a disruption score, and rituals at entry. We now want to deepen the nuance and responsiveness of the AI facilitator.

Objective:
Enhance the AI moderator’s presence and logic by adding a smarter reflection engine, dynamic tone adjustment, and a gentle onboarding message. We also want to add a visual typing indicator for better UX.

Key Changes to Implement:

1. ✨ Welcome Message at Conversation Start
- When both participants have entered and sent at least one message, have the AI moderator send:
  > "Welcome, both of you. I’m here to gently support this shared space. Let’s begin with curiosity and care."
- Only do this once per session.
- Trigger this after both participants have messaged and before reflections begin.

2. 🌡️ Replace Reflection Timer with Health-Based Logic
- Remove or override random message-based reflection timer (every 4–6).
- Instead, every 3 messages per participant, run a **Conversation Health Check**:
    - Analyze tone for emotional polarity swings (e.g. confusion → anger)
    - Check message dominance ratio
    - Look for principle violations (see below)
    - If overall "health score" dips below 0.7 (on 0–1 scale), trigger reflection.
    - If score is > 0.85, skip reflection and continue in silent mode.

3. 📜 Principle Checkpoints
Run semantic checks against these principles:
- “Ask, Don’t Assume”: Flag judgmental statements (e.g., "you are just..." or "people like you...").
- “Honor the Space Between”: Trigger if one user ignores or dismisses another repeatedly.
- “Respect Before Inquiry”: Trigger if tone is aggressive, dismissive, or invalidating identity.
- If any flag is triggered, increase disruptionScore slightly and favor **clarity-focused**, not poetic, reflections (see #4).

4. 🗣️ Tone-Adaptive Reflections
- If disruptionScore < 2: use poetic inquiry tone.
- If disruptionScore >= 2: shift to grounded tone with specific examples (mentor-like, not vague).
Example:
  > Instead of "How might you listen deeper?" use:  
  > "It sounds like one of you is feeling unseen. Would it help to pause and ask, 'What do you need right now?'"

5. 🔁 Typing Indicator ("[X] is typing…")
- Implement a small UI indicator that shows when each participant is typing.
- Suggested UI:
  - Show “🌿 Soaring Hawk is typing...” or “🌱 Listening Deer is typing…” at the bottom of the message thread.
  - Style it subtly to not disrupt the visual serenity of the experience.
- Use `socket.io` to emit typing events:
    - On keypress (with debounce ~250ms), emit `userTyping`
    - Stop after 1 second of no typing

6. ✅ Optional Extras (if time allows)
- Log reflection trigger reasons (e.g. “Tone spike: frustration + assumption”)
- Store reflection type used (poetic / grounded) for later insight tracking

Clarifications:
- We're using GPT 3.5-turbo for now (not 4), so keep prompts concise and efficient.
- We’ll handle visual metaphor refinements (soil bloom/growth) in a separate task.
