## Emergent Grounds — Session Ritual & Guardian Design

### Purpose
This document outlines two connected features to deepen the intentionality and emotional safety of Emergent Grounds conversations:

1. **Entry Ritual** – a guided flow that prepares users for meaningful dialogue.
2. **Guardian AI** – a real-time moderation system that softly intervenes when the space is at risk.

These two work in tandem to frame the conversation as sacred and to protect its integrity.

## 1. ENTRY RITUAL (State Machine Before Room Join)

### ✨ Description:
Before two participants can join a conversation, each must complete a simple sequence that centers them and affirms their intent. Once both are ready, they are ushered into a shared threshold moment before the chat begins.

### 🔄 Flow:

1. **User lands on session entry screen**
   - Message: “You are about to enter a space for shared presence.”

2. **Guided Ritual Steps (UI screens or modals):**
   - Step 1: Animated breath cue (e.g. expanding circle)
   - Step 2: Personal affirmation checkboxes (must confirm all):
     - [x] I enter this space with openness
     - [x] I will meet the other with care, not assumptions
     - [x] I leave behind my urgency. I bring presence
   - Step 3: Symbolic action (e.g. click to light a virtual candle or water the soil)

3. **Waiting Room (if second user not ready)**
   - Message: “Waiting for the other to complete their ritual.”

4. **Shared Threshold Moment (when both are ready)**
   - Soft animation + shared poem (optional)
   - Message: “Like rivers meeting at the ocean, you now step into shared stillness.”
   - Continue → Opens chat room

### 🛠 Claude Implementation Notes:
- Add ritual state machine before joining the Socket.io room.
- Only allow access when both clients emit `ritual_complete`.
- UI animations can be minimal for now (fade-in text + button).
- Use poetic copy. No need for complex timers or user input validation.

## 2. GUARDIAN AI (Tone-Aware Moderation System)

### 🛡 Description:
A lightweight AI moderation layer listens in silently, and gently intervenes if the tone of the conversation drifts into sarcasm, hostility, or over-dominance.

### 🎯 Trigger Rules (start simple):
- Any message with profanity / flagged sentiment
- More than 3 messages sent in a row by the same user
- Sudden use of all-caps, exclamation bursts, or rhetorical questioning

### 🪶 Intervention Tiers:

1. **Soft Nudge (First Warning):**
   - “Let’s slow the pace. Is what you’re about to say in service of understanding?”

2. **Mirror Prompt (Second Infraction):**
   - “You’ve shared a lot. What space might we leave for the other to unfold?”

3. **Session Disruption (Final Tier):**
   - “This space depends on mutual care. Perhaps it’s best to return when ready to listen again.”
   - Optionally, disable user input until they re-do a shorter reflection step.

### 🛠 Claude Implementation Notes:
- Use `moderator.checkTone(message)` in AI Moderator class
- Integrate OpenAI moderation endpoint or use keyword heuristics
- Store per-user message count + last intervention time (avoid spammy checks)
- Tie warnings to the entry affirmations: “Remember what you affirmed as you entered.”

## ☯️ Design Philosophy
- **Ritual = Entry Intention**
- **Guardian = Active Presence**
- Both should feel calm, poetic, and *never punitive*
- The aim is to protect the container, not punish the participants
