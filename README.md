# Emergent Grounds

ðŸŒ± This is the source repo for [Emergent Grounds](https://emergentgrounds.org) â€” a project for building intelligent common ground through shared presence and co-created insight.

## About Emergent Grounds

Emergent Grounds creates a humanistic, inquiry-driven space where individualsâ€”regardless of background, belief, or biasâ€”can explore difficult conversations through mutual understanding, shared presence, and co-created insight.

This is not about debate, winning, or agreement. It is about *emergence*. The space between participants is treated as sacred and alive, and it is there that new understanding, new compassion, and new ideas can arise.

## Foundational Principles (Code of Care)

1. **Honor the Space Between:** Truth does not live in either of usâ€”it lives between us.
2. **Respect Before Inquiry:** Acknowledge the other's worth, independent of appearance, background, or behavior.
3. **Stay in the Moment:** Truth emerges through presence, not preconception.
4. **Ask, Don't Assume:** Curiosity is the engine. Assumptions are the brakes.
5. **Co-discover, Don't Convince:** This is not about conversion but creation.
6. **Slow Down to Tune In:** Pauses are part of the rhythm.
7. **Leave With More Questions:** Completion isn't resolution, but insight that leads to more depth.
