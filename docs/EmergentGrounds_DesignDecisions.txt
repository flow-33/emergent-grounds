🌱 Core Metaphor: The Garden
- Conversations take place in a shared "garden" space.
- Insights are visualized as flowers, growing over time.
- Participants "plant seeds" during conversations.
- AI may suggest flowers to "water" after a session (reinforcement of recurring insights).

🌸 Insight Bloom Graph
- Nodes = insights (quotes, reflections, realizations)
- Edges = connections based on context, similarity, and participant affirmation
- Blooms = individual conversations
- Forest = the ecosystem of accumulated insight over time

🪄 Conversation Modes
1. Sandbox Mode – full free text, exploratory
2. Structured Mode – multiple choice options (RPG style)
3. Guided Expressive Mode – freeform with optional nudges
4. Interpreted Mode – AI rephrases gently for clarity or tone
Users can toggle between modes or be guided contextually.

💬 Language Handling
- Verbatim (raw)
- Gently cleaned (spelling, grammar, clarity)
- Interpretive (core idea distilled poetically or diplomatically)
Users can preview translations or toggled views.

⏳ Sync / Async Mode
- Sync: Real-time presence (like live chat)
- Async: Post-and-wait (pen-pal energy)

🌀 Identity & Anonymity
- No permanent profiles
- No demographic analytics
- Identity remembered through ritual or restoration (e.g. answering key MCQ questions)
- Garden visualization is personal: you see your flowers, not others’.

🌟 Resonance Token System
- After a session, both participants can privately choose to reconnect in the future.
- Only matched if both express interest. Contact info remains hidden.

🛡️ Moderation & Safety
- "Gatekeeping by gardening": Soft reflection nudges over punishment.
- “Do you feel this reflects the tone you’d like to bring here?”
- Gradual moderation for repeated trolling.

🧭 Default Experience
- Narrative onboarding (story/ritual/metaphor)
- Guided intention-setting
- Facilitated co-inquiry
- Reflection moment
- Garden update

🌿 Self-Growth & Reflection
- Your own garden blooms with repeated insights.
- Values and themes emerge over time.
- Periodic "Insight Recaps" allow participants to track their evolution.
