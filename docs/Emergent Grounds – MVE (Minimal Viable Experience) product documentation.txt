**Emergent Grounds – MVE (Minimal Viable Experience) Flow**

---

**🎯 Purpose:**
To prototype a spirit-aligned, real-time conversation space where two people can enter the "garden" and tend to the space between them. This experience should embody Emergent Grounds' values of presence, anonymity, inquiry, and co-created insight.

---

**🌱 Entry Point:**
Landing page at `emergentgrounds.org`

CTA: **“Tend the Space Between – Start a Conversation”**

Small poetic subtext:
> "Where words meet wonder. Step into a space of shared presence."

---

**🌼 Matching Interface:**
- User clicks "Start a Conversation"
- If **no one else is present**, they are taken to a **waiting garden**
  - Message: *“The soil is ready. Waiting for someone to meet you here…”*
  - Optional calming animation (e.g., a slowly blooming flower)
- If **someone else is already waiting**, match them

---

**🧚 Conversation Ritual Begins:**
- Both participants are assigned **random poetic names**
  - Examples: “Quiet Willow” & “Curious Stream”
  - Name pairs drawn from a library of `tone + nature/entity`
- AI welcomes them with a **ritual opening**
  - Lights digital candle
  - Shares guiding intention
  - Prompts both users to set a short shared goal (e.g. “What might we unearth today?”)

---

**💬 Real-Time Chat Interface:**
- Simple, clean interface for conversation
- System labels each message with their random name (no timestamps needed)
- AI serves as **gentle guide**:
  - Suggests inquiry prompts
  - Offers “Reflection Moments”
  - Surfaces moments of potential insight as **Insight Seeds**

---

**🌸 Conversation Closure:**
- When one user ends (or both confirm ending):
  - AI gives a poetic summary
    > *"Today the garden received… 3 insight seeds, a shared breath, and a gentle challenge.”*
  - Users are invited to **plant any key insights** into the Common Garden
    - (No login required – insights stored as public artifacts)

---

**🪄 Constraints & Ethos:**
- No profiles or logins
- No tracking by IP or identity
- All contributions are anonymous by default
- Participants can’t see each other’s details (except their poetic names)
- Observers **not supported** in MVE to preserve intimacy

**🗺️ Next Phase: Technical Build Tasks for Claude**
1. **chat-ui.html / style.css / app.js setup**
2. Name generation utility (random poetic names)
3. AI system prompts logic
4. Real-time session handling (e.g. WebSocket or Railway function)
5. Insight planting flow
6. Final recap + optional reflection export

Each task will be separated into its own Claude-ready file, maintaining context.
