Project Title: (Working Title) The Axis of Humanity: Notes Toward a Quiet Revolution

Concept:
A collection of poetic meditations, crystalline insights, and living reflections drawn from the Emergent Grounds spirit and conversations. Not quite poetry. Not quite philosophy. A tapestry of truth-markers. The aim is not to argue, explain, or instruct, but to remind. These are seeds for reflection, written to be returned to, like a garden of orientation points in a chaotic world.

Why:
Because sometimes, what shifts people isn’t information, but evocation. A line that lands. A question that lingers. A metaphor that melts the armor of ideology.

Tone & Style:

Rooted, not lofty

Poetic, but not ornamental

Gentle, clear, soul-tugging

Modern-day Gibran meets relational systems thinking

Possible Themes (each can be a section):

The Space Between

Harm & Dehumanization

Presence & Listening

The Sacred Ordinary

Tending as Resistance

What We Call Evil

Curiosity as a Door

Seeds, Soil, Bloom (metaphor of the garden)

Memory, Forgetting, and Re-membering

Kindness Without Naivety

Echo vs Emergence

Fragments to seed it with (captured so far):

“And perhaps the most insidious form of evil today is the idea that nothing sacred exists between us anymore.”

“We don’t oppose evil with violence, force, or outrage. We starve it with relationship. With radical understanding. With coherence.”

Format Ideas:

Each spread has one quote + short reflection

No authorship attribution—this is not about ego, but insight

Could also include symbolic visuals (plants, threads, open hands, roots)

Working Title Candidates:

Tending the Space Between

A Garden of Becoming

The Quiet Revolution

Seeds of Coherence

Between Us, A Field

Notes:
This is not just a book. It’s a portable form of Emergent Grounds itself. A ritual object. A mirror. A gift. A prompt. A moment of breath.
