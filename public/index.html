            <h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
            <p>We live in a world that moves too fast to feel. Too binary to hold complexity. Too loud to hear what's soft and true.</p>
            <p>Emergent Grounds is not an app, a script, or a debate. It's a garden spaceâ€”where insight blooms between us. Where we meet in our unknowing, and walk away changed.</p>
            <p>This is a framework for inquiry, not argument. For transformation, not transaction. For emergence, not certainty.</p>
